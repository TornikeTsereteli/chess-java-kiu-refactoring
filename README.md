# Chess Game Refactoring Summary



## üîß Overview

The original project suffered from serious architectural flaws and numerous bugs. It mixed concerns across layers, had poor class responsibilities, and lacked maintainable structure. This document summarizes the refactoring process and the improvements made.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Initial Problems

- Domain classes mixed game logic, view rendering, and data management.
- The `Piece` class was overcomplicated and hard to extend.
- Movement and checkmate logic was broken or missing:
    - Knights could capture friendly pieces.
    - Checkmate was not detected correctly.
    - Players could ignore checks entirely.
- The code violated multiple SOLID principles.
- The codebase was not modular or testable.
- It lacked proper project structure.

## ‚úÖ Separation of Concerns

Originally, domain classes mixed:
- Game state
- Rendering logic
- Business logic
- Data storage

To address this, I separated rendering concerns into dedicated classes:
- `BoardRenderer`
- `PieceRenderer`
- `SquareRenderer`

Now, each class has a single responsibility, aligning with the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.

---

## ‚úÖ Simplified Piece Class

The `Piece` class was too complex and contained utility logic like:
- `getDiagonalMoves()`
- `getHorizontalMoves()`

These were moved to a `MovementUtils` helper class, reducing duplication and complexity inside the `Piece` class.

---

## ‚úÖ Strategy Pattern for Movement Logic

To support flexible and extendable movement logic for different pieces, I applied the **Strategy Pattern**:
- Introduced `MovementStrategy` interface with specific implementations per piece
- Introduced `MoveExecutionStrategy` interface to encapsulate how pieces perform moves

This made it easier to add advanced behaviors (e.g., castling, en passant) in a clean, modular way.

---

## ‚úÖ MVC Architecture and Controller Layer

Previously, the view communicated directly with the model. I introduced a `GameController` to act as a mediator:
- The view accesses the model directly for rendering
- All state mutations happen through the controller

This follows the MVC architecture and makes the game logic more maintainable and testable.

---

## ‚úÖ Interface Segregation in View

The view logic had violations of the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** ‚Äî classes depended on methods they didn‚Äôt use.

This was fixed by introducing:
- `BoardMouseHandler` for event handling
- Segregated interfaces for rendering

---

## ‚úÖ Rewritten Checkmate Detection

The original `CheckmateDetector` was:
- Buggy
- Complex
- Hard to understand

I rewrote it from scratch:
- Introduced a clean interface with a simple implementation
- Used a simulation-based approach: If the king is in check and no legal move can resolve it, it‚Äôs a checkmate
- Developed an **undo system** to simulate and rollback moves safely

The result is readable, testable, and functionally correct.

---

## ‚úÖ Maven Project Structure

I restructured the entire codebase into a standard **Maven project**, bringing:
- Proper separation of `src/main` and `src/test`
- Better dependency management
- Cleaner build process

---

## Result

After these changes:
- The code adheres more closely to **SOLID** principles
- The project is ready for future extension (e.g., AI, castling, network play)
- Code quality, readability, and maintainability have improved significantly

---

## üß† Remaining Improvements

While the architecture is now solid and extendable, some refinements are still possible:

- The `Piece` class **still stores image data**, which mixes model and view logic. This responsibility should be moved elsewhere.
- Some classes still **carry mixed responsibilities** and can benefit from further refactoring.
- Communication between model and view could be **improved using DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** to further decouple rendering from the core logic.
- Additional helper classes could be extracted to make responsibilities even more granular.
